# Brainstorm

Brainstorm is a collection of brain pickings on the philosophies of life and existence from the folks who commute the London Underground, the New York City Subway, and the Shanghai Metro. The intent of this site is threefold - to spread the wisdom of the common man, to give a shoulder during the gloomy days and to inspire people into action.
